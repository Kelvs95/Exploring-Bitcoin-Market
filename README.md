OVERVIEW
To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 
In this project, we explored the market capitalization of Bitcoin and other different cryptocurrencies.
Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. 
We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). 
Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future. 
In fact, on the 6th of December of 2017, Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion.
WARNING: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. 
Cryptocurrencies mentioned here might be scams similar to Ponzi Schemes or have many other issues (overvaluation, technical, etc.). 
N/B: Please do not mistake this for investment advice.
The CSV file used for this project was downloaded on the 6th of December, 2017. 
The public record went private in 2020 and it is no longer available for public use.

ANALYSIS
The first process of analyzing this data was first to import the Pandas and Matplot Libraries and cleaning of the data.
How Big is Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies? 
Plotting a bar chart of the top 10 cryptocurrencies as at the time of the data used, 
you’ll see that Bitcoin is more than 50% of the entire cryptocurrency market amidst serious competitions from other cryptocurrencies.

VOLATILITY IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES:
Some of the cryptocurrencies here are no longer existent in this present time but taking a close look at how volatile cryptocurrencies are. 
We took a quick look into the DataFrame. The changes in price within 24 hours and 7 days for some of these cryptocurrencies were alarming. 
To show you that indeed, the market is a very volatile market and a lot of care should be put into venturing into the world of cryptocurrency.
It seems you can lose a lot of money as well as make a lot in this market because of how volatile it is.
How small is small? As with stocks, and many other financial products, the smaller the capitalization, the bigger the risk and reward. 
Smaller cryptocurrencies are less stable projects in general, and therefore even riskier investments than the bigger ones
N/B: Cryptocurrency as an asset class is not directly comparable to stocks. More so, there is no clear cut definition of what “small” or “large” stock is.
From the data collected for this project, it shows that most cryptocurrency companies are ranked between mid cap to nano cap, 
with bitcoin being the only cryptocurrency in the Large Cap family. 
This shows that the market is more than 50% Bitcoin and there is an imbalance of power in the market which makes it highly volatile.
